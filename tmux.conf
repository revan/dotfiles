# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
bind s split-window -v
bind v split-window -h

# move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 10
bind > resize-pane -R 10
